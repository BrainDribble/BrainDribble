Hi,

Iâ€™m @BrainDribble (Aka Steve Dawson leaving in Australia).

Having recently retired from IT project management Iâ€™m interested in doing some coding.

My interest stems from a Computer Science bakground and initial software developer career (C, assembler, Pascal, Fortran77 !!!).

Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub, Python and Arduino and trying to remember my old unix days.

No collaboration planned as such.  Just want to use a structured environment for my projects as a learn and seek out examples and help when I get stuck.
